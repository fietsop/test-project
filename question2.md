To address the compliance controls specified in the CIS Benchmark Level 1 for Windows Server 2019 on the host "bastion1", I will utilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to codify and automate the remediation tasks. I will focus on remediation for two specific compliance controls:

    2.2.21 Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network' to include 'Guests, Local account, and member of Administrators group' (MS only)
    18.9.45.4.1.2 Ensure 'Configure Attack Surface Reduction rules: Set the state for each ASR rule' is configured – ‘26190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869'

Solution Overview:

1. Deny Access to Computer from the Network:

I will create a Terraform script that configures the security policy to deny network access for specified accounts.

2. Configure Attack Surface Reduction Rules:

Another Terraform script will be created to configure the attack surface reduction rules as specified in the compliance control.

Implementation Steps:

1. Terraform Script for Denying Access to Computer from the Network:

resource "null_resource" "deny_network_access" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = <<EOF
      $accounts = @("Guests", "Local account", "Administrators")
      foreach ($account in $accounts) {
          # Set the security policy
          secedit /export /cfg C:\temp\temp.cfg
          $config = Get-Content C:\temp\temp.cfg
          $config = $config -replace ("SeDenyNetworkLogonRight = \*", "SeDenyNetworkLogonRight = *S-1-5-32-546")
          $config | Out-File C:\temp\temp.cfg
          secedit /configure /db $env:windir\security\database\secedit.sdb /cfg C:\temp\temp.cfg /areas USER_RIGHTS
      }

      # Clean up temporary files
      Remove-Item C:\temp\temp.cfg
    EOF
  }
}

2. Terraform Script for Configuring Attack Surface Reduction Rules

resource "null_resource" "configure_asr_rules" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "powershell -Command Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids '26190899-1602-49e8-8b27-eb1d0a1ce869' -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled"
  }
}
